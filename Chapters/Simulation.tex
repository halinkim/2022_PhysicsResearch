\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, we describe the initial data set required prior to simulation, the numerical method for evolution, and the results.

\section{Schwarzschild black hole}
\subsection{Types of black holes}
Accordingly to the No-Hair theorem, all black holes solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equation of electromagnetism in general relativity can be completely characterized by their observable classical parameters mass, electric charge and angular momentum.

The schwarzschild metric describes the spacetime geometry exterior to any spherical collapsing body. Kerr metric describes the geometry of empty spacetime around a rotating uncharged axially-symmetric black hole with quasi-spherical event horizon. There are also the Reissner-Nordström metric and the Kerr-Newman metric that describe charged black holes\parencite{vindana2018simulation, wald2010general}. In Table~\ref{tab:typeofblackholes}, it can be seen that the types of black holes are classified according to angular momentum and charge.

\subsection{Isotropic coordinate}

In this report, we choose the simplest form, the Schwarzschild black hole. The original form of the Schwarzschild metric is
\begin{equation}
	\dd{s^2} = - \qty(1 - \frac{2M}{r}) \dd{t^2} + \qty(1 - \frac{2M}{r})^{-1}\dd{r^2}+r^2\qty(\dd{\theta^2}+\sin^2\theta\dd{\phi^2}).
\end{equation}
When $r$ goes $2M$, $g_{rr}$ diverges. However, this is just a coordinate singularity, like the problem that occurs at the north and south poles in the spherical coordinate system\parencite{zee2013einstein}. This can be solved by choosing another coordinate system, such as the Kruskal coordinate system.

We can avoid coordinate singularity at $r=2M$ by adopting an isotropic coordinate system by substituting $r=\bar{r}(1+M/2\bar{r})^2$, we get
\begin{equation}
	\dd{s^2} = - \qty(\frac{1-M/(2\bar{r})}{1+M/(2\bar{r})})^2 \dd{t^2} + \qty(1 + \frac{M}{2\bar{r}})^{4}\qty(\dd{\bar{r}^2}+\bar{r}^2\dd{\theta^2}+\bar{r}^2\sin^2\theta\dd{\phi^2}).
\end{equation}
This coordinate system describes the area outside the event horizon $\bar{r}=M/2$. The reason for using this coordinate system is as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A spatial metric is numerically valid in any space where $r>M/2$.
	\item Since spatial metrics are flat, they can be replaced with Cartesian coordinates, which is more useful for numerical calculations\parencite{brugmann1996adaptive}.
\end{enumerate}
So, in practice we use metric:
\begin{equation}
	\dd{s^2} = - \qty(\frac{1-M/(2r)}{1+M/(2r)})^2 \dd{t^2} + \qty(1 + \frac{M}{2r})^{4}\qty(\dd{x^2}+\dd{y^2}+\dd{z^2}),
\end{equation}
where $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.

\section{Gauge conditions}
Eq. (\ref{eq:hamiltonian_constraint})-(\ref{eq:evoultion_extrinsic}) does not contain any time derivative of lapse function $N$ nor of the shift vector $\shiftvec$. This means that $N$ and $\shiftvec$ are not dynamical variables. Therefore, we may choose the lapse and shift freely, without changing the physical solution $g$ of the Einstein equation\parencite{gourgoulhon20123+}.

In this simulation, we choose the lapse function and the shift vector
\begin{equation}
	N = \frac{1-M/(2r)}{1+M/(2r)}, \qquad \shiftvec = 0.
\end{equation}

\section{Initial data}
After 3+1 decomposition, we should evolve forward in time some initial data. Instead of solving Hamiltonian and momentum constraint, we use well-known initial data from isotropic coordinates of Schwarzshcild metric. So the initial spatial metric becomes $\gamma_{ij}=(1+M/(2r))^4\delta_{ij}$ and the initial extrinsic curvature becomes $K_{ij} = -\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{L}_{\bm{n}}\gamma_{ij} = 0$.

We will show that these data satisfies Eq. (\ref{eq:hamiltonian_constraint}, \ref{eq:momentum_constraint}). Since $E$ and $p_i$ are all $0$ in vacuum space and $K_{ij}=0$, the momentum constraint is naturally satisfied. Now, to satisfy the hamiltonian constraint, we need to show that the 3-metric Ricci scalar $R$ is $0$. Let's use a spherical coordinate system here. The non-vanishing Ricci tensor is:
\begin{align}
	R_{rr} &= - \frac{8 M}{r \left(M + 2 r\right)^{2}},\\
	R_{\theta\theta} &= \frac{4 M r}{\left(M + 2 r\right)^{2}},\\
	R_{\phi\phi} &= \frac{4 M r \sin^{2}{\left(\theta \right)}}{\left(M + 2 r\right)^{2}}.
\end{align}
Therefore, it can be seen that the 3-metric Ricci scalar $R = \gamma^{ij}R_{ij} = 0$, and it can be confirmed that the given constraint condition is well satisfied.

\section{Numerical methods}
\subsection{Finite difference method}
This simulation uses the finite difference method. The Taylor expansion of the function $f(x)$ in $x_0$ is
\begin{equation}
	f(x_0 + h) = f(x_0) + \frac{f'(x_0)}{1!}h + \frac{f^{(2)}(x_0)}{2!}h^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}h^n+ \cdots .
\end{equation}
Arranging this, we get
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h} &= f'(x_0) + \frac{f^{(2)}(x_0)}{2!}h + \cdots \\
		&= f'(x_0) + \mathcal{O}(h).
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Accuracy is on the order of $\mathcal{O}(h)$.

The central difference method selects the function value from $x-h$ and $x+h$, respectively, and has a more accurate error of $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$.
\begin{equation}
	f'(x_0) = \frac{f(x+ h) - f(x - h)}{2h} + \mathcal{O}(h^2).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Boundary condition}

The isotropic coordinates of the schwarzschild metric only describe the region outside the black hole horizon, i.e. $r=\frac{M}{2}$. Therefore, $\gamma_{ij}$ and $K_{ij}$ were fixed in the region of $r\le \frac{M}{2}$.

At the boundary outside the grid, the physical quantity at the corresponding point was calculated using linear extrapolation. For example, when we need to find the derivative at $f_i$,
\begin{align}
	(\partial f)_{i - 2} &= \frac{f_{i - 1} - f_{i - 3}}{2h},\\
	(\partial f)_{i - 1} &= \frac{f_{i} - f_{i - 2}}{2h}.
\end{align}

Therefore, we get
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
			(\partial f)_{i} &= \frac{f_{i - 1} - f_{i - 3}}{2h}\\
			&= \frac{2f_i - f_{i - 1} - 2f_{i - 2} + f_{i - 3}}{2h}.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Alternatively, there is a way to use a fixed value at the grid boundary, as well as at the black hole horizon.

\subsection{Inverse matrix}

Cofactors were used to find the inverse matrix. See Appendix \ref{AppendixA}.

\section{Grid setting}

The size of the grid is $100^3$, the mass of the black hole is $0.2M$, and the grid distance is $0.01M$. Thus, the horizon of a black hole corresponds to $0.1 M$, i.e. the surface of a sphere with a radius of 10 grids.

\section{Result}

The results obtained at first do not change with time as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:0_data0}.

\end{figure}

However, when the errors in the coordinate system of the lapse function and minor errors were corrected, the metric could no longer be considered static as shown in Figure 1.
